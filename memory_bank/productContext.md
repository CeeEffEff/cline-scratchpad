# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The PR Documentation Generator exists to automate the creation of comprehensive documentation for Pull Requests. This addresses several key challenges in software development:

1. **Knowledge Transfer**: Provides clear documentation of changes for team members who need to understand the PR
2. **Code Review Efficiency**: Helps reviewers quickly understand the scope and impact of changes
3. **Historical Context**: Creates a permanent record of why and how changes were made
4. **Onboarding**: Helps new team members understand the evolution of the codebase
5. **Compliance**: Supports audit requirements by documenting all changes to the system

## Problems It Solves

1. **Inconsistent Documentation**: Standardizes PR documentation format and content
2. **Missing Context**: Captures the full scope of changes including business logic, configuration, services, etc.
3. **Manual Effort**: Automates the tedious process of documenting PR changes
4. **Incomplete Analysis**: Provides a comprehensive view of changes and their impacts
5. **Knowledge Silos**: Makes PR information accessible and understandable to all team members
6. **Large PR Complexity**: Handles large PRs with many files through explicit context management

## How It Should Work

1. **Automated Triggering**: The workflow is triggered when a PR is ready for documentation
2. **PR Information Retrieval**: Uses GitHub CLI to fetch PR metadata and modified files
3. **File Analysis**: Examines files before and after changes to understand modifications
4. **Graph Representation**: Stores information in Neo4j memory server using MCP tools
5. **Intelligent Entity Recognition**: Identifies business logic, configuration, services, and other components
6. **Context Management**: Handles large PRs with explicit context management
7. **Documentation Generation**: Creates a structured markdown document following the required format
8. **Output**: Produces a comprehensive PR documentation file that can be shared with the team

## User Experience Goals

1. **Minimal Configuration**: Users should not need to provide extensive configuration
2. **Comprehensive Output**: Documentation should cover all aspects of the PR
3. **Structured Format**: Documentation should follow a consistent, easy-to-read format
4. **Insightful Analysis**: Documentation should provide insights beyond just listing changes
5. **Contextual Understanding**: The system should understand the purpose and impact of changes
6. **Error Handling**: The system should gracefully handle errors and edge cases
7. **Scalability**: The system should work with PRs of any size through context management
