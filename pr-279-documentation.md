# PR #279: Final Job Metrics via gRPC Intercept and AWS WIF

## PR Overview

- **Title:** feat: PT-1025 - Final job metrics via grpc intercept and AWS WIF
- **Author:** Conor Fehilly (CeeEffEff)
- **Created:** August 22, 2025
- **Updated:** September 8, 2025
- **State:** MERGED
- **Type:** Feature Implementation
- **Intent:** Implement final job metrics tracking via gRPC interception and AWS Workload Identity Federation authentication

This PR implements a robust system for tracking and updating metrics for jobs in terminal states (Failed or Done) using gRPC interception of Firestore operations. It also adds AWS Workload Identity Federation (WIF) authentication via a shared service account to reduce configuration overhead.

## Business Logic Changes

### Job Metrics Update Logic

- **Purpose:** Updates metrics for jobs when they reach terminal states (Failed or Done)
- **Implementation:** Located in `src/seomax/implementations/metric_client_interceptor.py`
- **Key Features:**
  - Intercepts Firestore commit operations to detect job state changes
  - Patches final ES metrics for jobs in terminal states
  - Implements error handling for JSON parsing and general exceptions
  - Logs debug and warning information for monitoring
- **Impact:** Ensures final metrics are pushed once jobs are either Failed or Done, improving data completeness and accuracy

## Configuration Changes

### AWS WIF Configuration

- **Purpose:** Configures AWS Workload Identity Federation authentication
- **Implementation:** Located in `src/seomax/constants/constants.py`
- **Key Parameters:**
  - `SHARED_SA_EMAIL`: Email address for the shared service account
  - `IMPERSONATE_FOR_AWS_WIF`: Flag to control impersonation behavior
- **Impact:** Enables AWS WIF Authentication for metric patching operations

## Service Changes

### Shared Service Account

- **Purpose:** Provides a centralized service account for authentication
- **Implementation:** Located in `terraform/resources--services/accounts.tf`
- **Key Features:**
  - Used by AWS WIF Authentication
  - Reduces configuration overhead across services
- **Impact:** Simplifies service account management and authentication

## Dependency Changes

- Multiple service `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files updated to include:
  - AWS SDK dependencies (boto3, botocore)
  - gRPC-related dependencies
- Example: `src/api/Pipfile` (2 additions) and `src/api/Pipfile.lock` (71 additions, 5 deletions)

## Schema Changes

No significant schema changes were identified in this PR.

## Infrastructure Changes

### Service Account Configuration

- **Purpose:** Define and configure the shared service account in Terraform
- **Implementation:** Located in `terraform/resources--services/accounts.tf`
- **Key Features:**
  - Creates a shared service account for all services
  - Configures appropriate IAM permissions
- **Impact:** Enables centralized authentication for AWS WIF

## CI/CD Pipeline Changes

Minor updates to the GitHub Actions workflow:
- `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` (2 additions)
- Likely adds environment variables for AWS WIF authentication

## Impact Analysis

### Direct Impacts

1. **Metric Tracking Robustness:**
   - Intercepting gRPC messages at the transport level ensures all Firestore operations are captured
   - More robust than adding metric pushing to CRUD methods, as it applies by default to all requests

2. **Authentication Flexibility:**
   - WIF can be used for AWS Authentication when patching metrics (but not when creating them)
   - Shared service account reduces configuration overhead across services

3. **Service Updates:**
   - All services changed to use the tracked (intercepted) Firestore client
   - Consistent metric tracking behavior across all services

### Potential Wider Impacts

1. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Additional interception layer may have minor performance impact on Firestore operations
   - Logging and metric updates add slight overhead to commit operations

2. **Maintenance Considerations:**
   - The interception approach is designed to be robust to changes in the Firestore library
   - Only unary gRPC operations are currently intercepted, as the Firestore `DocumentReference` class only uses `commit` under the hood

## Conceptual Changes

### gRPC Interception Pattern

- **Purpose:** Intercept and modify gRPC operations at the transport level
- **Implementation:** Custom transport class and interceptor for Firestore operations
- **Key Features:**
  - Dynamically creates a custom transport class
  - Intercepts specific gRPC methods (currently only `/google.firestore.v1.Firestore/Commit`)
  - Processes responses to extract and update job metrics
- **Impact:** Provides a robust, library-change-resistant approach to tracking operations

### AWS Workload Identity Federation

- **Purpose:** Enable Google service accounts to assume AWS IAM roles
- **Implementation:** `AWSWIFAuthenticator` class in `aws_wif_authenticator.py`
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses AWS STS to assume role with web identity
  - Creates AWS SigV4 signatures for API requests
  - Supports both impersonated and native OAuth tokens
- **Impact:** Simplifies cross-cloud authentication between Google and AWS
